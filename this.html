1.What should I do to get rid of acne??
</p>
<p> The best treatments inhibit sebum production, limit bacterial growth, or encourage shedding of skin cells to unclog pores. Because many therapies can have side effects, any patient with acne should proceed with caution when trying a new treatment. People with any type of acne that lowers their self-esteem or makes them unhappy, those with acne that is leaving scars or people with severe, persistent cases of acne, need the care of a dermatologist.</p>
          
<p>2.Frequent body pains, bone stiffness. Maybe Arthritis??</p>
<p>Different types of drugs can treat memory loss, behavior changes, sleep problems, and other Alzheimer’s symptoms. They don’t stop the disease, but they can keep the problems from getting a lot worse for a few months or even years.</p>
            
<p>3.Do the sun and pollution get under your skin. Skin diseases maybe?</p>
<p> Pollution is an inevitable fact of life. You can take steps to shield your skin from its harmful effects. Here’s how:

-Stay hydrated to flush toxins through your system and keep your skin (and entire body) healthy.
-Choose your skin care products wisely that contain protective ingredients such as vitamins A, C and E.
-Cleanse your skin thoroughly each day to remove the layer of dirt.

Protect your skin from the damaging effects of the sun by slathering sunscreen onto your skin. Know your needs when it comes to sun protection.</p>
